- Multiline comments



Bugs in documentation:
- In example code in MIDAS page, it's written WAIT Seconds 60. And in reference keyword is seconds
- "Parameters can be defined either centrally for all scripts in the ODB under /Experiment/Edit on sequence. " The sentence is incomplete



Questions
- SCRIPT name, value --> can we run scripts at server side?
- ODBSET path, value --> boolean values? "true", true, 1, t... ???
