# Labor setup for Arria10 and FEB Communication

this branch contains the firmware for the FEB and the Arria10 development board for sending slow control from the
Arria10 board to the FEB in a simple labor setup. One can also send data from the FEB to the Arria10 board and read it
out via PCIe and DMA.
