All:
 - Check if US/DS approach currently works
 - LVPowerOn --> check if ladder_id and config needs to be saved as input. Probably lader config has to be saved. Maybe ladder_id_US and ladder_id_DS to be checked afterwards
 - Solve all todo's from each file

IV --> add US/DS support
LVPowerOn --> add UP/DS support
link_qual --> save error rates as a function of VPVCO and VNVCO magic values
link_qual --> add PARAM to ask user to provide number of seconds (ask Luigi)
