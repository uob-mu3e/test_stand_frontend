This directory contains a set of do files to compile mutrig into a separate library,
as well as forcing scripts to force a valid configuration vector and simulation related values into the ASIC.
The source if the ASIC is not included in this repo, the path to the repo has to be given in the files for compilation.

For performing the compilation run in the vsim shell from your testbench directory:
do ${path_to_here}/compile_asic.do ${path_to_mutrig_repo}/units/ 

In a testbench instanciating the asics with instance names "asic0,1", run 
	do force_asic.do asic0 0
	do force_config.do asic0
	do force_asic.do asic1 1
	do force_config.do asic1

in order to force a configuration vector and simulation constants (such as asic number (=1) and channel, required for text output) at the beginnning of the simulation.
There will be some warnings about unbound instances when running the simulation, this can be ignored because they are all analog blocks.
